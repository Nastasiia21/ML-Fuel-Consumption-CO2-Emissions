# Vehicle Attributes Analysis and Forecasting
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and forecasting project for vehicle attributes, utilizing a diverse set of statistical and machine learning techniques to predict future trends up to the year 2050. The project is implemented in Python and leverages several powerful libraries and models to provide a holistic view of vehicle characteristics and their evolution.
## Project Overview
The project is structured around a multi-layered analytical approach:
    Descriptive Analysis: Initial exploration of the dataset to outline its distribution and fundamental characteristics.
    Inferential Statistical Analysis: Application of T-tests and Chi-Square tests to explore relationships and differences among various vehicle attributes.
    ML: Utilization of Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNeighbors, Multilayer Perceptron, and XGBoost for predictive modeling. 
    Timeseries Analysis: Integration of the Facebook Prophet model for robust long-term forecasting up to 2050.
